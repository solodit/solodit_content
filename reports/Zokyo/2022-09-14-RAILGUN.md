# Findings

## Low Risk

### Unlocked pragma version in Voting.sol and Delegator.sol.
**Description**

The solidity pragma version is not locked for both Voting.sol and Delegator.sol which is imported in the Voting.sol contract, in the hardhat config file right now the version selected is 0.8.12, but by having a pragma version that is not locked this can be prone to errors, an example of such an error is that in the moment the contracts get compiled with a version lower then 0.8.7, there will be a compilation error because of conversion from bytes to bytes4 at line 102 in Delegator.sol

**Recommendation**

Lock the pragma version to 0.8.12

### Missing gas left check in for loops in Voting.sol.
**Description**

In contract Voting.sol, there are two for loops functions, one at line 207 and one at line 408, it is recommended that inside the loop functions to implement a break condition that will check the gasLeft() and will break the function iteration if the gas is lesser then 20 000 units to not run into the out of gas error, in the case of an "out of gas error", the gas it is not returned but in a case of reverting from an require or revert function or from execution breaking the gas it is returned.

**Recommendation**

Implement a check inside the loops that will check for the gas left and will intrerupt the execution of the function using the break keyword to not be able to run in the "out of gas error"

## Informational

### Gas optimization for STAKING_CONTRACT variable type.
**Description**

In contract Voting.sol, at line 102, variable STAKING_CONTRACT is of type Staking, and the variable it is used inside the contract to do external calls to a certain address at lines 204, 250, 320, 352. To better optimize the gas usage, it is recommended that STAKING_CONTACT to be of type address, and do an in-place initialization using an interface where you want to do an external call, this will greatly reduce the gas costs, because you will only read from the storage the address instead of an object of type Staking which is greatly more expensive.

**Recommendation**

Change the type of STAKING_CONTRACT to address and do an in-place initialization using the interface where you are doing external calls at lines 204, 250, 320 and 352.

### Gas optimization for DELEGATOR_CONTRACT variable type.
**Description**

In contract Voting.sol, at line 103, variable DELEGATOR_CONTRACT is of type Delegator, and the variable it is used inside the contract to do external calls to a certain address at line 407 inside a for loop. To better optimize the gas usage, it is recommended that DELEGATOR_CONTRACT to be of type address, and do an in-place initialization using an interface where you want to do an external call, this will greatly reduce the gas costs, because you will only read from the storage the address instead of an object of type Staking which is greatly more expensive.

**Recommendation**

Change the type of DELEGATOR_CONTRACT to address and do an in-place initialization using the interface at line 407

### Variable packing in ProposalStruct for gas optimization.
**Description**

In contract Voting.sol, at line 60, the struct ProposalStruct it is defined, to be in accordance with best practices and to optimize the gas usage it would be recommended to implement variable packing inside structures definitions.

**Recommendation**

Refactor the structure so it will be in accordance with the variable packing patter.

### Gas optimization for loop increment (line 207).
**Description**

In contract Voting.sol, at line 207, there is a for loop that could be better optimized by changing the i++ inside the for loop to an unchecked arithmetic because the i variable is of type uint256, and you will run out of gas before being able to iterate enough for an overflow

**Recommendation**

Change the structure of the i++ instruction to an unchecked one to better optimize the gas.
// Loop over actions and copy manually as solidity doesn't support copying structs
for (uint2561 $i=0;$ i < actions.length;) {
proposal.actions.push(Call(
_actions i].callContract,
_actions[i].data,
_actions i].value
0);
unchecked
++1;
}

### Gas optimization for loop variable `actions` (line 405).
**Description**

In contract Voting.sol, at line 405, there is a for loop that could be better optimized by changing the variable actions from storage to an in memory variable, because the gets used in the for loop and at every use the value will be read again from the storage, which can become expensive after a lot of operations.

**Recommendation**

Change the variable actions form in storage to an in memory variable. (The modification can be observed in the image from above)
