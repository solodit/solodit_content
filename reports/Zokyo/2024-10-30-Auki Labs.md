# Findings

## Low Risk

### Lack of emitting an event

**Severity** - Low

**Status** - Resolved

**Location** - DomainNFT.sol

**Description**

The setStakingContract() is missing an event when the stakingContract variable is updated.

**Recommendation** 

Add a relative event in the function.

## Informational

### Could use delete keyword

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Resolved

**Location** - StakingContract.sol, StakingERC1155Contract.sol

**Description**

In the StakingContract.sol, the slash() and _withdraw() functions update all elements of the stakes[_staker] to 0.
Basically, it could use delete keyword to delete the entire struct.

The same for the slash() and withdraw() functions for the StakingERC1155Contract.sol.

**Recommendation** 

Please use “delete stakes[_staker];” instead of updating all elements to 0.


### Floating pragma

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Resolved

**Location** - All contracts

**Description**

All the contracts use pragma solidity ^0.8.20.
This may result in the contracts being deployed using the wrong pragma version, which is different from the one they were tested with.

**Recommendation** 

It is recommended to lock the pragma version.

### Excessive external call to this.nonPendingBalance()

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Resolved

**Location** - RewardLiquidityPoolContract.sol

**Description**

The increaseFixedAmount() and increaseDynamicAmount() functions make excessive external calls to this.nonPendingBalance() even if the nonPendingBalance() is not external and it doesn’t validate msg.sender.

**Recommendation** 

Remove this keyword.


### Lack of using cached variable

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Resolved

**Location** - StakingERC1155Contract.sol

**Description**

The withdraw() and slash() functions read _s.amount from storage once more for the zero comparison even if the _amount memory variable is declared.

**Recommendation** 

Use _amount instead of _s.amount for the zero comparison.

### initSupplySubTargetSupply Can Be Stored In Variable Instead

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

In contracts BurnContract.sol and DomainNFT.sol ‘s calculateMintAmounts() function the initSupplySubTargetSupply  is calculated by subtracting the TARGET_TOTAL_SUPPLY from the INITIAL_TOTAL_SUPPLY , since these are constants,  the value of initSupplySubTargetSupply will always be the same , therefore instead of calculating it everytime the function is invoked the value can be stored in a variable instead.

**Recommendation**: 

initSupplySubTargetSupply  can be stored in a variable and queried everytime calculateMintAmounts() is invoked.
