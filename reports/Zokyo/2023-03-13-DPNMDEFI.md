# Findings

## High Risk

### Transferring Ownership can lead to undefined behavior

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

phenomanelTree.sol - Transferring ownership after deployment can cause a class of issues because the logic is built upon about the assumption that the root of the tree is the owner of the contract. Effects will follow when transferOwnership is used: 1- isUserExist will return faulty result because it assumes owner is the root, hence old owner might show that he does not exist in the tree anymore and be added to the tree again. 2- Similarly, getUserDistance will return a faulty result because it assumes owner to be the root of the tree.

**Recommendation** 

Rather than assuming owner to be the root of the tree, introduce a new address variable that is immutable and assigned to the root of the tree on deployment.
Address immutable public rootOfTree;

**Fix** - In commit 60761c1, new variable rootOfTree is assigned to the first user added to the tree. Issue is resolved,  provided that the deployer of phenomanelTree is the same deployer of dpnm_sc.

 

### Tree Level incompatible

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol / phenomanelTree.sol - tree depth is incompatible between the dpnmMain and phenomanelTree. Contract dpnmMain assumes depth of tree is 10 while phenomanelTree is built to be 15.

**Recommendation** 

Match the tree depth.

**Fix** - It is meant to be as a spec in order to leave room for future products as according to developers depth will be adjustable up to 15.


### Exposure to sandwich attack

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - buydPNM & sellDPNM are exposed to slippage sudden price change, hence an attacker can take advantage of that by manipulating price to turn against a victim.

**Recommendation** 

A suggestion proposed, add an argument to the methods to represent the slippage in price like this: buydPNM(uint BUSDamount, uint slippage) or buydPNM(uint BUSDamount, uint minAmountdPNMReceived). This new argument will be validated by a require statement like require(userTotaldPNMdeposit >= minAmountdPNMReceived). In that case an undesirable change in price would make the trade revert.


**Fix** - Issue has been acknowledged by developers, and they showed that incentive of the attacker to exploit such vulnerability is estimated to be insignificant, hence we consider this is part of the game theory/business logic of the product.

### Modifier onlyAllowed potentially causes DoS

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

phenomanelTree.sol - modifier onlyAllowed() is applying an exhaustive search on array elements of allowedContracts . Given that allowedContracts can be appended indefinitely without even an option to remove elements, this can potentially lead to a denial of service on the methods using the modifier.

**Recommendation** 

use a map for allowedContracts
mapping(address => bool) allowedContractsMap;
 
 
### totalUsers of tree is missing one

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

phenomanelTree.sol - totalUsers of tree reflects the number of participants in the tree. Despite that, right on deployment on constructor call, we have the owner of the contract added as one of the participants but totalUsers is not incremented and stays holding a zero value.

treeUsers[msg.sender] = Tree(address(0),address(0),address(0),address(0));
treeuserlevels[msg.sender] = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0];
// NB: missing initializing totalUsers

What makes the issue of a High severity is that it messes the synchronization with the corresponding value of totalUsers in dpnm_sc contract.

**Recommendation**

Ensure totalUsers is equal to one on deployment to match the number of actual users.
A better recommendation is to refactor the code in a way that you rely on a single source of truth. In this situation, better rely on totalUsers in phenomanelTree contract after correcting its value.
**Fix** - Issue fixed in 60761c1.


### Buying limits can be broken with a significant impact

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - In method getMaxDailyBuy a user can break the limits significantly by applying a certain pattern of buys and sells within a 2-day window. It is understood though that paying fees on those buy/sell operations serve as a disincentive for the users (i.e., attackers in this case). Attackers can still apply the pattern if the wins overcome the fee loss. This can also serve the attackers to make an impact on price against a victim buyer, which is another issue mentioned in this report.
Pattern:
Day-1 :  | buy x -> sell x -> buy x -> sell x ... 100 times          |
Day-2:   | Wait for buy period to pass                                 |
Day-3 :  | buy 100x   (breaking the limit)                             | 

The issue mainly arises from the fact that the sell period is bigger than the buy period.

**Recommendation** 

Choose the sell period to be at least 35 seconds less than the buy period (24 hours). In other instead of having soldLast48Hours let it be like soldLast24HoursMinus35Seconds by applying this check users[user].tokenData.lastSellTime + 24 hours – 35 seconds > block.timestamp 
Instead of:

**Fix** - Issue has been acknowledged by developers and the incentive of the attacker has been estimated by a real world example and shown to be insignificant, hence we consider this is part of the game theory/business logic of the product.

### Underflow/overflow cases are not avoided

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

phenomanelTree.sol - Testing has shown that in cases where we are filling trees for different users, sometimes unexpected revert messages are received (i.e. related to underflow/overflow) while the expected message according to the use case is Tree is filled. By investigating this we see that underflow cases are not avoided, for instance we have the following (i.e. on calling positionUser):
lvlsDeep -> take any value 0-255.
Triggers findPositionSpot, we find that lvlsDeep should have been validated to be non-zero because of lvlsDeep-lvl and lvl starts by 1.
Triggers calcTreeNetwork, we find _depth which should be at least 1 to have a proper for loop. Since we have lvlsDeep-lvl=_depth while maximum value of lvl can be lvl+1 we see it ends up having _depth = -1 which is not possible as it reverts.
Also, based on previous point, lvlsDeep-lvl should be less than 15. Otherwise, it goes out of bounds of array index. Therefore, lvlsDeep < 16 because lvl >= 1.
Underflow/Overflow might be more severe if we face those errors in valid states; we need to be careful to avoid them.

**Recommendation** 

After Refactoring the data representation of phenomanelTree as recommended in other issues. This part needs to require statements that validate input to be added in the right places in order to avoid unintended revert messages. Reimplementing this method in order to avoid that is also needed.

**Fix** - Require statement has been added in order to validate that input is within an acceptable bound. Code fix is presented in 60761c1.

### Tree does not extend as expected

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

phenomanelTree.sol - Starting from positionUser, testing showed that the tree of a given referrer does not get filled as expected (i.e. according to given depth). For instance, if depth is 11 we expect to have 265720 nodes but only 1093 are added.

**Recommendation** 

Algorithm and parameters used in checks might need to be readjusted. It is noticed that the capacity of nodes gets decreased according to a pattern to fit a smaller depth.
**Fix** - Tree of each individual user is shown in test to be filled up to the expected capacity after fix is carried out on commit 05ec745 .



## Medium Risk

### Transfer of busd to same recipient is unnecessarily repeated in loops

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - busd.safeTransfer(feeCollector, ...) is repeated in loop in both methods: _TreePayment and depositFordPNMBuy, safeTransfer is a costly operation, and it can be called only once on the total amount to be transferred, rather than repeating it unnecessarily.

**Recommendation** 

Declare a variable for the amountToBeTransferred and increase it each time you need to make the transfer. After reaching the target amountToBeTransferred do the actual transfer.
```solidity
uint256 amountToBeTransferred;

for (uint i=0; i <10; i++)  
   amountToBeTransferred += amountToBeAdded
busd.safeTransfer(feeCollector, amountToBeTransferred);
```
**Fix** - Codefix in 60761c1 introduced amountToBeTransferredToFeeCollector in _TreePayment. Also we have feeCollectorBonus in method depositBonusFordPNMBuy.



### Exposure to revert due to underflow

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - in getMaxDailyBuy this line:


Is exposed to a panic revert (leads to Denial of service) in some valid cases due to underflow.

**Recommendation** 

Just switch the ordering of last two quantities.
buyLimit = buyLimit + uint(soldLast48Hours) - uint(last24BuyAmount);
Fix - Issue fixed in 60761c1.

### Centralization Risk

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Admin enjoys too much authority in contracts. The general theme is that admin has power to call several state changing functions also affecting the tokenomics of the project. Some functions can be highly severe to be left out, controlled by one wallet.

**Recommendation** 

Apply governance methods or use multisig wallets.

**Fix** - Developers stated they are planning to utilize multisig wallets.

### Unchecked return

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - In buyTurnoverWithGWT(uint) & buyEarnLimitWithGWT(uint) , the return value from the burning operation of gwt is not validated gwt.burn(msg.sender, gwtCost).
In buydPNM(uint) & selldPNM(uint) , the return value from the minting operation of gwt is not validated gwt.mint(msg.sender, gwtCost).

**Recommendation** 

Wrap in require statement: 

```solidity
require(gwt.burn(msg.sender, gwtCost), ...).
require(gwt.mint(msg.sender, gwtCost), ...).
```
**Fix** - Issue fixed in 60761c1.

## Low Risk


### Optimize gas cost needed for transfer of busd to users

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - in depositBonus Issue is similar to Transfer of busd to same recipient is unnecessarily repeated in loops, but it is dealt with in a different way. Method depositBonus includes busd.safeTransfer(userAddress, ...). Mehtod depositBonus is repeated in loops in the implementations of _TreePayment and depositBonusFordPNMBuy.

**Recommendation** 

This kind of use case is mostly implemented in the following way in DeFi:
Instead of transferring the busd right away, add the amount of reward to be paid for the users in a mapping state variable like:
mapping(address => uint256) bonusToBePaid;

while the actual busd rewards (i.e., bonuses) are sent as a whole to a reward pool (or the same contract). Users later claim their rewards from the reward pool in a separate transaction triggered by them, like this:
bonusToBePaid[userAddress] -= amount;
rewardPool.safeTransferBUSDBonusTo(userAddress, amount);

**Fix**: Developers acknowledged the issue and they showed their awareness about it. They preferred accessibility for users (i.e. simplicity to deal with their ecosystem) than following the more common practice.


###  Pragma version lock

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

It’s recommended to have the same compiler and flags that the contracts were tested with the most. This way, it reduces the risk of introducing unknown bugs by accidentally deploying with the latest version that might not be stable yet.

**Recommendation**: 

Lock pragma versions


**Fix** - Resolved in 05ec745


### Some public visibilities are unneeded

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

phenomanelTree.sol / dpnm_sc.sol / gwt_new.sol - functions declared as public while they are not used internally in the contracts.
function getUserData(address account) public view returns (uint, uint, uint, uint, uint) 
function getUserBuySellData(address account) public view returns (uint, uint, uint, uint, uint) 
function getLvlsLockStatus(address user) public view returns(bool[10] memory) 
function getLostProfit(address account) public view returns (uint[10] memory) 
function promoter() public view onlyOwner returns(address) 
function changeLock() public onlyOwner() 
function changeFeeCollector(address newCollector) public onlyOwner 
function changePromoter(address newPromoter) public onlyOwner 
function setDailyBuyLimit (uint amount) public onlyPromoter 
function setGWTforActivation (uint amount) public onlyPromoter 
function setDaysForTree(uint amount) public onlyPromoter 
function setMaxDaysForTree(uint amount) public onlyPromoter 
function setbuyFeeToLiquidity(uint amount) public onlyPromoter 
function setsellFeeToLiquidity(uint amount) public onlyPromoter 
function setgwtTransFeeLiquidity(uint amount) public onlyPromoter 
function setturnoverForOneGWT(uint amount) public onlyPromoter 
function setdPNMbuyTurnoverIncrease(uint amount) public onlyPromoter 
function setgwtBuyIncrease(uint amount) public onlyPromoter 
function setgwtSellIncrease(uint amount) public onlyPromoter 
function setdPNMsellTurnoverIncrease(uint amount) public onlyPromoter 
function setearnLimitDepositedPerc(uint amount) public onlyPromoter 
function setStakingDailyProfit(uint amount, uint stakingID) public onlyOwner
function addAllowedContract(uint allowedContract) public onlyOwner
function returnAllowedContract(uint index) public view onlyOwner returns (address)

**Recommendation** 

Declare as external.

**Fix** - Developers fixed the access modifier of methods in 60761c1, but still exist methods declared as public and not invoked internally:
dpnm_sc: changeFeeCollector, changePromoter, makeTreePayment, buydPNM, selldPNM, transfer, buyTurnoverWithGWT, buyEarnLimitWithGWT, changeLock, name, symbol, decimals, totalSupply, balanceOf, disablePrestartMode
gwt_new: changeFeeCollector, returnAllowedContract
phaneomanelTree: getTreeRefs, getUserDistance
As of commit 05ec745, dev team left this issue unaddressed.
The issue was resolved in commit 8e4592d


### allowedContracts is publicly viewable while it should not 

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

phenomanelTree.sol - allowedContracts array is publicly available to be viewed, while in the same time returnAllowedContract which shows an element of the aforementioned array is only accessible by owner ! If allowedContracts should be a secret, then it should not be available to read for the public.

**Recommendation**: 

To be consistent, we either have returnAllowedContract available for all callers with no onlyOwner modifier (i.e. no secret). Or limit the access of allowedContracts and make it internal to avoid revealing it.

**Fix** - allowedContracts array is replaced by allowedContractsMap mapping in commit 60761c1. Therefore, the issue is no longer relevant and considered resolved.


### Unnecessary assignment of array in treeuserlevels

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

phenomanelTree.sol & dpnm_sc.sol - treeuserlevels[newUser] is actually an array of zeros by default.


Similarly, in constructor

Also in dpnm_sc:





**Recommendation** 

remove the all zero array initialization lines.

**Fix** - Issue fixed in 60761c1.


### Dangerous nested loops

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

phenomanelTree.sol - In findPositionSpot, while loop is including a for loop (inside calcTreeNetwork). Nested loops in solidity are not recommended in blockchain.

**Recommended** 

Rethink the data representation and use mappings whenever possible in order to avoid nested loops

**Fix** - Issue acknowledged by dev team.



### Data representing tree users, mismatch can take place

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - in init, msg.sender is added to users of the tree in the contract dpnmMain, but there is no guarantee that the deployer msg.sender of dpnmMain is the root of the tree in phenomanelTree.
In regard to that is apparent from the context of the project that tree users should be matching in dpnmMain and phenomanelTree but in that mentioned simple scenario they can be mismatched.

**Recommendation** 

retrieve the root of the tree in phenomanelTree and make it be the first added user in the body of method init().
better solution is to represent the address of the root in a new variable treeRoot not using owner() (PS. This is related to another highly severe issue mentioned in this draft)
users[phenomanelTree(_treeAddress).treeRoot()] = user
// Apply same idea on the rest of user related tree data

It will be better though to rely solely on tree Users from the phenomanelTree contract to have a single source of truth.
**Fix** - Acknowledged by dev team as they ensure that deployment goes the way it is supposed to be carried out in order to avoid this issue.


### Interactions preceding the effects


**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - in activate, dealing with smart contracts requires care, that's why we are obliged to abide by certain patterns. One such pattern is checks-effects-interactions. Method activate does not follow checks-effects-interactions pattern, as it creates the user after interacting with the phenomanelTree.


Similarly, in the body of buydPNM(...): we have interactions busd.safeTransferFrom(...) and gwt.mint(...) better be called after the effects.
As for: buyTurnoverWithGWT(...) and buyEarLimitWithGWT(...) we have gwt.burn preceding state changes (i.e. effects):


And,


**Recommendation** 

Effects like createUser(...) which update the internal state of contract should precede interactions like contractTree.positionUser(...).
**Fix** - Issue fixed in 60761c1.

### No uint value input validation applied on methods

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - in selldPNM No assurance that the value of BUSDamount should be non-zero value. Also, it will be safer to assure that dPNMprice is non-zero. Also, same applies to:

function buyEarnLimitWithGWT(uint earnlimitAmount) public onlyActivated notPrestart 
function buyTurnoverWithGWT(uint turnoverAmount) public onlyActivated notPrestart 

**Recommendation**

add a validation statement require(BUSDamount > 0 && dPNMprice >0, ...)
add a validation statement require(earnlimitAmount > 0, ...)
add a validation statement require(turnoverAmount > 0, ...)
**Fix** - Issue fixed in 60761c1.


### Wasteful array representation for variable

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - treeuserlevelslock is represented as a mapping of an array. The array represents the last level reached by the userAddress that maps to that array. The pattern that it takes is in the form of a stream of trues followed by a stream of false till the end of the array (e.g., [true, true, true, false, false]). So the only information needed is to know the index of the last true right before the first false. This shall save some computation and space as there will be no need to use loops in order to process it.

**Recommendation** 

make it mapping(address => uint8) treeuserlevelslock instead of an array. uint8 represents the index of the level reached.

**Fix** - Issue fixed in 60761c1 by introducing mapping variable firstLockedLvl to replace treeuserlevelslock. 

## Informational

### Variable to be declared as constant

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - minDailyBuy is shown to be immutable, therefore it is better to be declared as a constant.

**Recommendation** 

uint constant public minDailyBuy = 50e18;


### Misleading variable name

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - name choice of minDailyBuy refers to something completely different to what it actually is. Since it should be referring to the default lower bound of maxDailyBuy not the minimum amount to buy daily.

**Recommendation** 

Rename it to something like: lowerBoundMaxDailyBuy, defaultMaxDailyBuy, ... etc.

**Fix** - Issue fixed in 60761c1.

### No validation on input address

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - input address in init, changePromoter & changeFeeCollector might be zero and assignment of such improper address would be set in this case.
gwt_new.sol - input address in init, addAllowedContract & changeFeeCollector might be zero and assignment of such improper address would be set in this case.

**Recommendation** 

add a require statement to ensure the input addresses are non-zero addresses.

**Fix** - Issue fixed in 60761c1.


### Code logic repeated can be replaced by function

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol - in init(...), the logic of creating a new user is already implemented in private function createUser(address,address).

**Recommendation** 

use :
createUser(treeRoot, address(0));

instead of the bulky logic of user creation inside the init(...) method.
**Fix** - Issue fixed in 60761c1.


### Replace a frequently used number by a constant

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

phenomanelTree.sol & dpnm_sc.sol - depth of tree, which is assigned to be 15. This number is repeated throughout the contract, and it's not considered a good coding pattern. Similarly, the same is occurring in dpnm_sc.sol in treeDepth is declared to represent the depth of tree (i.e. 10 in this case) but it is almost never used where it should be used.

**Recommendation** 

Declare a constant that represents depth of tree in phenomanelTree (i.e. TREE_DEPTH=15) and use the constant instead. Same with dpnmMain.

**Fix** - Acknowledged by dev team.


### Unused variable

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

phenomanelTree.sol - In positionUser, variable lvlDistance is unused.

**Recommendation** 

Put the variable in a require statement to check if it is within the expected bound that should be returned from the method.

**Fix** - Issue fixed in 60761c1.


### Gas Optimization.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol -  In the  depositBonus 
Values of the treeuserlevelslock mapping are all booleans. So there is no need to compare with true or false. It will cause more gas consumption.

if(treeuserlevelslock[userAddress[7] == true){

**Recommendation** 

remove the true.
if(treeuserlevelslock[userAddress[7]){
**Fix** - Issue fixed in 60761c1



### Wrong Function description.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

dpnm_sc.sol -  In the  depositBonus 
For dPNM bonus requires that token value less than earn limit left.
But in the description, dev wrote that token value should be greater than earn limit left.

**Recommendation**: 

Change `greater` to `less`.\
**Fix** - Issue fixed in 60761c1
