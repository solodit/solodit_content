# Findings

## High Risk

### Votes are not cleared when a voter is removed.

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

TestStake::setOwnersAndMinimumSignatures().

When changing the `topHolders` array to remove an account that voted in the current active
voting for contract upgrade, the function does not remove that account's vote. Thus, when
modifying `topHolders` during active voting, the votes of those not in the current array may
be included. The issue could result in an unauthorized upgrade of the contract
implementation outside the majority choice. In this case, the assets stored in the contract
and the correctness of its logic may be at risk. The auditors, therefore, recommend removing
the votes of accounts that are no longer part of `topHolders` for the active (or last) voting.
The issue is marked as high since it may disturb the flow of voting and possibly be used to
vote for an older or even malicious upgrade version, which should have been rejected.

**Recommendation**:

Remove the votes of accounts that are no longer part of `topHolders` for the active voting.

**Post audit.** The Wallek team has updated the voting flow. Now, the Admin only sets the
current active implementation for which DAO members can vote. DAO members can revoke
votes for any implementation for which they voted previously. However, such flow still might
have several issues, specifically:
The same implementation can be put on vote multiple times. The approvals for such
implementations (`approvals[_newImplementationAddress]`) and specific votes per
implementation of previous DAO members (voted[topHolder[i]]
[_newImplementationAddress]) are not cleared.
Since specific votes are not cleared, if a previously approved implementation is put on vote
again, DAO members who previously voted for it won’t be able to vote. If they use the
function revokeVote(), they could potentially disturb the current voting process because
their vote is not counted in `approvals[_newImplementationAddress]`).
The implementation is passed as a function parameter in the function _authorizeUpgrade().
However, the validation checks for the current `proposedUpgradeContract` to have a
minimum number of signatures instead of `_newImplementation`. The approvals, however,
are cleared for `_newImplementation`. This may be potentially abused if the function
upgradeToAndCall() is called directly.

**Recommendation:**
1) Clear votes in mappings `approvals` and `voted` fo previous implementation when
proposing a new one. Also, clear votes in `voted` when upgrading to a new
implementation. Othewise, consider making each implementation ever proposed and
not allowing it to be voted on again.
2) In the function `_authorizeUpgrade, ` check signatues for `_newImplementation` or
consider ignoring the parameter and only interacting with the stoage variable
`poposedUpgadeContact`.
**Post audit.** When a new implementation is poposed, or an upgrade is invoked, all votes for
implementation are cleared. In the function `_authorizeUpgrade`, checks are perfomed for
the `proposedUpgradeContact` implementation.

## Medium Risk

### The 'topHolders array is not checked to be a unique set.


**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

TestStake::setOwnersAndMinimum Signatures()::topHolders.
The array is not validated in order not to contain duplicates and the zero address. Thus, the same or zero address can be specified several times in the array. The issue can lead to unexpected behavior in further use, which is why it is recommended to validate parameters.

**Recommendation:**

Validate the array to be a unique set.

**Post audit**. The array is checked to not contain zero addresses or duplicates now.

### Block of the emergency withdrawal of arbitrary tokens.

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

TestStake::emergency WithdrawErc20()::availableBalance. The local variable availableBalance is calculated independently of the address of the withdrawn ERC20 token. Consequently, during the withdrawal of an arbitrary token when token != stakeToken, underflow may occur because the sum totalTokenLocked + totalFeeCollected exceeds the balance.

**Recommendation:**

Calculate this variable only when token == stakeToken'.
Post audit. Available balance is calculated correctly now.

### Disruption of existing stakes when replacing the stake token.

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

The procedure for changing the 'stakeToken address does not consider that the contract balance may still contain locked funds of the previous token. Changing the 'stakeToken' address will break the contract's staking logic and block users from withdrawing their funds. The issue affects both the previous token because of the locked balance and the new token because of recorded stakes not made for it. The problem is marked as a medium since users won't withdraw previous stakes until the owner returns the staking token to a previous one.

**Recommendation:**

Take into account the stake tokens for which they are performed in the staking processes.
Post audit. The functionality for updating stake tokens was removed.

### Reward amount of 'stakeToken might be taken from users' stakes when unstaking stakeToken2`.


**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


TestStake::unStakeAndBurn()#2095.
When 'stakeToken2' is unstaked and burnt, a user receives a corresponding amount of 'stakeToken'. This amount is equal to the total amount of 'stakeToken2', that a user unstakes; thus, it is not connected to the user's stakes of 'stakeToken. Hence, this amount of 'stakeToken must be provided as additional rewards allocated by the protocol to the smart contract balance in advance. Otherwise, the amount of 'stakeToken' will be taken from users' deposits, leading to the lack of tokens on the contract's balance and preventing later users from withdrawing their staked 'stakeToken'.
The issue is marked as a medium since it depends on the owner's action to provide the necessary 'stakeToken. However, if tokens are not provided, users may lose their staked 'stakeToken'.

**Recommendation:**

Validate the correctness of the current flow. Ensure that the contract has enough balance of `stakeToken' to ensure tokens sent to users during the burning of 'stakeToken2 are not taken from deposits of 'stakeToken.
**Post audit**. It is now validated that 'stakeToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - total TokenLocked - totalFeeCollected' is greater than withdrawnAmount'. Thus, rewards can be paid out from users' deposits.

## Low Risk

### The quorum number is not validated to be greater than the number of voters.


**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**


TestStake::setOwnersAndMinimumSignatures().
There is no check for the quorum number 'minSigRequired against the length of the `topHolders' array in the setter function. Therefore, the quorum number can be set greater than the number of voters. In this case, the quorum becomes unreachable until the function with correct parameters is called again, which involves rewriting the 'topHolders` array. Hence, the auditors recommend checking that the quorum number is, at most, the number of potential voters during the setting to prevent unplanned behavior and minimize gas consumption if incorrect parameters pass.

**Recommendation:** 

Validate `minSigRequired during settings.
**Post audit**. The quorum number is now checked to be less than the number of new DAO members.

### Unused variable.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TestStake::reStake()::totalWithdrawn.
The local variable totalWithdrawn accumulates stake amounts but is not used anywhere else in the function. It may indicate incomplete contract logic in the production code and lead to unintended incidents.
Consequently, the same applies to 'previousAmount", which is redundant and only used for totalWithdrawn.

**Recommendation:**

Complete the contract logic OR remove the variable.
Post audit. Unused variable was removed.

### Deprecated 'transfer usage.

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TestStake::emergency WithdrawMatic()#2167.
EIP1884 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884] increases the gas cost of certain opcodes, possibly making contracts go over the 2300 gas limit imposed by `transfer()` and unable to receive funds via transfer(). If the owner is a smart contract (e.g., a multisig) with a custom 'receive() function, the funds might not potentially be transferred until the owner is changed.

**Recommendation**: Use the function AddressUpgradeable.sendValue() by OpenZeppelin OR call' in the Consensys recommended way [https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using- soliditys-transfer-now/].

**Post audit**. sendValue` function is used now

## Informational

### Multiple reads of the same array length from storage in a loop.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TestStake: existsInArray()#2129. There is a 'for' loop that uses the 'length' field of the storage array in its loop condition and does not modify it. Since the 'for' loop on line 2129 does not modify 'topHolders.length', it is more gas-efficient to cache it in some local variable and use it instead.

**Recommendation:**

Create a local variable to cache this length.

### Unclear as to the rewards for staking.


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Using the' stake () function, a user can stake any amount for any period. A fee is charged for the specified amount during the staking process. Further, the user can withdraw the amount after the specified period using the 'unStakeAll() function. The comment above talks about the withdrawal of stake rewards, but this function does not implement the logic of reward withdrawal.
The contract does not provide other reward withdrawal functions. Moreover, the logic of the contract as a whole does not implement calculation, accumulation, and withdrawal of rewards. This can be misleading as to the contract's functionality, and other information on the mechanics of accumulation and withdrawal of rewards is not provided. Perhaps user rewards are handled by the Wallek back end, some external service, or another contract that is not mentioned.

**Recommendation:**

Confirm the process for user stake rewards.
**Post audit.** The team has verified that flow is implemented according to the business requirements.

### The latest version of Solidity can be used.


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TestStake is deployed with Solidity 0.8.20. The latest versions of Solidity fix bugs, provide the latest security checks, gas optimization and features. The current version is 0.8.25. It is worth noting that when migrating to another version, a contract should be qualitatively tested with it.

**Recommendation:**

Consider using the latest version of Solidity.

### Unclear purpose of the MATIC withdrawal function.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TestStake::emergency WithdrawMatic(). The 'TestStake contract does not have a fallback or receive function, but the function for withdrawing MATIC is implemented, and its use cases are not specified in the contract. It is worth noting that on the contract that does not implement fallback and receive functions, MATIC can be sent if another contract specifies the contract address as the recipient address when calling 'self-destruct. However, the contract does not specify such a use case. The issue leads to confusion about the purpose of this function and may indicate incomplete contract logic. In addition, since version 0.8.18 self-destruct is considered deprecated [https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/02/01/solidity-0.8.18-release- announcement/] because of EIP-6049 [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6049], and therefore not recommended for use.

**Recommendation:**

Confirm the function use case, OR complete the contract logic, OR remove the function.
Post audit. The Wallek team has verified the necessity of function in case MATIC is sent to contract by mistake.

### Unoptimized change of object values.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**
TestStake::reStake()#1957-1963,1934-1940.
In the loop, only the fields 'stakeAmount and 'claimTime of the iterated object are changed. However, instead of changing these fields, a new local object of the 'Stakes' structure is created, and the existing object is overwritten entirely. In the process, the 'startTime` and `endTime', read from the contract storage, and 'msg.sender are overwritten with the same values. This results in unnecessary gas consumption in the cycle. Instead, The auditors recommend modifying only the required fields of the structure and using a storage reference to the structure object. Also, use a storage reference for the 'stakeDetails mapping. Example:
```solidity
mapping (uint256 => Stakes) storage rStakeDetails =
stakeDetails[msg.sender];
Stakes storage rStake;
for (...) {
rStakerStakeDetails[i];
delete rStake.stakeAmount;
rStake.claimTime block.timestamp:
}
```
The same applies to the following parts:
• TestStake::stake()#1902-1908.
• TestStake::unStakeAll() #1985-1991.

**Recommendation:**

Modify only required values instead of overwriting an entire object and use storage references.

### Initializing local variables in a loop.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TestStake::unStakeAll() #1983.
TestStake::updateStakeWallet()#2017-2019.
The local variables are declared in a loop and, therefore, destroyed and initialized with each iteration. Declare variables outside of the loop to reduce gas consumption.

**Recommendation:**

Declare the variables outside the loops.
**Post audit.** Variables declaration is moved outside the loop now.

### Custom errors can be used.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

Starting from Solidity v0.8.4, custom errors are a convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to users why an operation failed.
Handling errors using require statements is rather expensive, especially in terms of deployment cost, and it is difficult to use dynamic information in them. Requirements with long string literals considerably increase the bytecode length. Also, they consume slightly more gas when returned than custom errors.
Therefore, auditors recommend using custom errors instead of require statements to reduce bytecode size and gas consumption and to provide more context and information about the reason for the error.

**Recommendation:**

Replace require-statements with custom errors.

### Unhandled check in upgradeable contract with constructor.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

The TestStake contract is the upgradeable contract that has a defined constructor using _disableInitializers(). In such a case, it is recommended to turn off the corresponding check to improve the usability of the OpenZeppelin upgrade plugin and to show that this is done intentionally. This can be achieved with the particular comment (/// @custom:oz- upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor) above the constructor according to the OpenZeppelin recommendation [https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing- upgradeable#initializing_the_implementation_contract].

**Recommendation:**

Use the special comment for the constructor.

### Multiple transfers to one account instead of transferring the total amount.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TestStake::unStakeAll() #1995.
Multiple stake amounts are transferred to one user in the function's loop. Instead, it is worth transferring 'totalWithdrawn at one time to prevent unnecessary gas consumption.

**Recommendation:**

Transfer the accumulated amount instead of multiple external calls.
**Post audit**. Only one transfer occurs now.


### Unused 'public' visibility.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TestStake: emergency WithdrawMatic(), feeWithdraw(), addFreezeWallet(), setOwnersAndMinimum Signatures(), revokeVote(), proposeAndVote Upgrade(), totalAmount(), updateStakeWallet(), unStakeAll(), reStake(), stake(), addNRemoveAdmin(), setStakeFee(), initialize().
The functions have 'public' visibility, yet they are not used anywhere inside the contract, inherited contracts, or derived contracts. Therefore, it is recommended that they be given 'external visibility to reduce gas consumption and improve code consistency and readability.

**Recommendation:**

Transfer the accumulated amount instead of multiple external calls.

### Possible misuse of a variable.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TestStake::reStake()#1954. In the function 'reStake()', a variable 'totalWithdrawn is calculated by counting values from all the user's stakes. However, the additional of 'stakeAmount from stake is performed based on whether the amount', which is user re-stakes, is greater than 0. In contrast, it might be possible that it should be performed based on the value of previousAmount and whether its value is greater than 0. The issue is marked as info since auditors can't currently define the severity level of it since the variable 'totalWithdrawn is never used later in the code (See Low-2 issue).

**Recommendation:**

Verify if the value of variable amount` OR `previous Amount should be validated in "if" statement.
Post audit. Variable totalWithdrawn was removed.

### Single-use local variables that do not save a value before overwriting.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TestStake::updateStakeWallet()::netAmount#2019.
TestStake::totalAmount()::amount#2054.
TestStake::checkClaim Expiry()::amount#2071.
Some local variables are used only once and do not save a value before being overwritten. In such cases, auditors recommend using the arithmetic expressions directly at the point of need without creating a local variable to prevent unnecessary gas consumption.

**Recommendation:**

Use the arithmetic expressions directly in these cases

### Minimum amount to stake might not be equal to 1 token.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TestStake::stake()#1896.
Function 'stake() contains validation with the following error: "Minimum Stake Amount is 1,"
which implies that a minimum of 1 token must be staked. The minimum cap is hardcoded to
be 1e8. This means that if the minimum amount to stake is 1 token, only tokens with 8
decimals will satisfy the condition and error message. However, when the staker token is set,
its decimals are not checked.

**Recommendation:**

Validate if only tokens with 8 decimals are used, in which case the validation and erroг message will correspond to each other. If the minimum amount is not considered to be equal to 1 token, consider changing the error message to describe the error correctly. Otherwise, if the minimum amount to stake must be equal to 1 token, consider using *10**token Decimals instead to ensure 1 token is staked for any stakeToken'.
**Post audit.** The condition was changed so that '10**tokenDecimals is used now.

### Wrong mapping is passed to the event.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TestStake::stake2()#1982-1983.
The function performs staking of 'stakeToken2' and writes the information about stakes in the mapping 'stake2Details". However, when emitting the event, information about stake is taken from the mapping 'stakeDetails', which holds information about stakes of 'stakeToken.'

**Recommendation:**

Pass information from mapping stake2Details to the event.

### Same events are used for 'stakeToken and 'stakeToken2'.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

TestStake::stake2()#1978.
TestStake::unStakeAndBurn()#1978.

When 'stakeToken2' is staked or unstaked, a corresponding event 'Staked' or 'Withdrawn is emitted. However, the same events are also used for 'stakeToken'. Since events don't have a field to specify a token, it may be difficult to aggregate them if it is needed to aggregate events for 'stakeToken' and 'stakeToken2 separately.

**Recommendation:**

Add or field to the events to specify tokens OR use separate events for 'stakeToken2.
Post audit. A field was added in the event 'Staked'. For the function unStakeAndBurn() a separate event Burn was added.

### Unnecessary condition.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Stake::unStakeAll()#1980, 2006.
Stake::unStakeAndBurn() #2016, 2041.
When someone initiates unstaking through 'unStakeAll' or 'unStakeAndBurn', the first verification checks if the sender has any unlocked stakes. The functions revert with the ZeroClaim Amount error if there are no unlocked stakes. However, during further execution of the functions, all values of the unlocked stakes are summed into the 'totalWithdrawn variable, which is then checked after the function body to ensure its value is greater than zero. If the first check was passed successfully, 'totalWithdrawn cannot equal zero.

**Recommendation:**

Remove unnecessary checks OR confirm the need for this check.

### Impossible condition; unreachable code.

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Acknowledged

**Description**

Stake::proposeAnd Vote Upgrade()#2187.
The check approvals [proposed Upgrade Contract] >= minSigRequired will constantly be equal to false, as 'approvals[proposed UpgradeContract] is invariably less than `minSigRequired at this stage. This is because the variable is incremented after the check, and the same check on line 2194 ultimately resets approvals [proposed UpgradeContract] to zero when executed.

**Recommendation:**

Remove unnecessary checks OR confirm the need for this check.
**Post audit.**
GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
• Unsupported OpenZeppelin implementation.
The contract provided uses several significant versions of OpenZeppelin at the same time. For example, the 'Address` and `Initializable contracts are inherited from version 5.0.0, and 'Reentrancy GuardUpgradeable and AddressUpgradeable from version 4.9.0. The same is true for other inherited contracts. Such modifications are unverified changes to the OpenZeppelin codebase and are not officially supported. They are not covered by the support, testing, and audits provided by OpenZeppelin for their code.
Recommendation: It is strongly recommended that the OpenZeppelin original
Thus, they are only considered safe with additional auditing and testing. implementation be supported, tested, and audited. We recommend using the latest version of the OpenZeppelin contracts.
• Lack of documentation.
The contract lacks NatSpec documentation for function formal parameters, returned values, mappings' and events' parameters. Documentation helps to:
• make the code more transparent and more readable, giving a fuller view;
• ensure code quality when written and modified;
• keep developers in sync and minimize unnecessary interaction;
• make it easier to integrate with other protocols.
It is therefore recommended to fully describe their action, calling requirements, features, formal parameters and return values, applying NatSpec where required.
It is worth noting that the Solidity documentation recommends [https:// docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html] contracts to be fully annotated using NatSpec for all public interfaces (everything in the ABI).
Recommendation: add the full NatSpec documentation.
• The optimizer is not used.
It was noticed that the optimizer was not used for the deployed 'TestStake contract. The optimizer simplifies complicated expressions, including specializing or inlining functions, to reduce bytecode size and execution cost. Therefore, we recommend using the optimizer when deploying contracts to reduce the contract deployment cost and gas used for external calls made to the contract. Recommendation: Use the optimizer when deploying contracts.
Recommendation: use the optimizer when deploying contracts.
