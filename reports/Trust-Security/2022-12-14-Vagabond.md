# Findings
Trust Security has conducted an audit at the customer's request. The audit is focused on
uncovering security issues and additional bugs contained in the code defined in scope. Some
additional recommendations have also been given when appropriate

## High severity findings

### TRST-H-1: Linear vesting users may not receive vested amount
- Category: Logic flaw 
- Source: TokenTransmuter.sol 
- Status: Fixed
- Description: TokenTransmuter supports two types of transmutations, linear and instant. In linear,
allocated amount is released across time until fully vested, while in instant the entire
amount is released immediately. transmuteLinear() checks that there is enough output
tokens left in the contract before accepting transfer of input tokens.
```solidity
require(IERC20(outputTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this)) >= (totalAllocatedOutputToken - totalReleasedOutputToken),"INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_TOKEN");
IERC20(inputTokenAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(0),_inputTokenAmount);
```
However, transmuteInstant() lacks any remaining balance checks, and will operate as long
as the function has enough output tokens to satisfy the request.

```solidity
IERC20(inputTokenAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(0),_inputTokenAmount);
SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(outputTokenAddress), msg.sender,allocation);
emit OutputTokenInstantReleased(msg.sender, allocation,outputTokenAddress);
```
As a result, it is not ensured that tokens that have been reserved for linear distribution will
be available when users request to claim them. An attacker may empty the output balance
with a large instant transmute and steal future vested tokens of users.

- Recommended mitigation: In transmuteInstant, add a check similar to the one in transmuteLinear. It will ensure
allocations are kept faithfully.
- Team response: Issue was fixed.
- Mitigation review: The suggestion has been implemented. transmuteInstant checks that a sufficient balance is
reserved for future linear vested tokens.

## Medium severity findings
### TRST-M-1 Vesting end time is not enforced
- Category: Insufficient validation
- Source: TokenTransmuter.sol
- Status: Fixed
- Description: vestingEntryCloseTime is defined to be the time when vesting ends. However, there is a lack
of check in transmuteInstant() and transmuteLinear(), that current time is lower than close time. Therefore, users may initiate new transmutations when desired period is over.
- Recommended mitigation: Add a timestamp check in transmuteInstant() and transmuteLinear()
- Team response: Issue was fixed.
- Mitigation review: Timestamp checks implemented successfully.

## Low severity findings
### TRST-L-1 Zero duration time causes divide-by-zero exception
- Category: Insufficient validation
- Source: TokenTransmuter.sol
- Status: Fixed
- Description: linearVestingDuration is used as the total period from start to end of vesting in linear
transmutation. It is set in the constructor and is fixed. There is no validation in construction
that the variable is not set to zero. When users call releaseTransmutedLinear() to claim
released tokens, _vestingSchedule() is called which divides by linearVestingDuration in one
flow.

```solidity
} else {
return (totalAllocation * (timestamp - start(_vester))) / duration();
}
```
This flow has no chance of completing as the function will revert with divide-by-zero
exception.
- Recommended mitigation: Require linearVestingDuration to not be zero in the constructor.
- Team response: Specific issue as well as addition safety checks implemented in the constructor.
- Mitigation review: Correct safety checks are included in the constructor.
### TRST-L-2 vestedAmount and vestedAmountAtTimestamp return false information for instant transmutations
- Category: Logical flaw
- Source: TokenTransmuter.sol
- Status: Fixed + minor issue
- Description: `vestedAmount()` and `vestedAmountAtTimestamp()` are view functions for user to see their
vested amount currently and in a given timestamp respectively. The issue is that they
assume user is on a linear vesting plan, rather than instant vesting. Therefore, they will
display false information because instant vesting users will not receive any additional
released amounts later.
- Recommended mitigation: Add a requirement in both functions, that user is in the linear vesting plan, using the
addressToVestingCode mapping.
- Team response: Issue was fixed.
- Mitigation review: Both functions now support linear and instant vesting. However, vestedAmountAtTimestamp may still return incorrect results for timestamp < time of vesting
for instant vesting. Function does not take into account timestamp of `transmute()` call.
```solidity
if (addressToVestingCode[_vester] == 1) {
return addressToTotalAllocatedOutputToken[_vester];
} else if (addressToVestingCode[_vester] == 2) {
return _vestingSchedule(addressToTotalAllocatedOutputToken[_vester], uint64(_timestamp), _vester);
}
```
### TRST-L-3 Multiplier implementation causes limited functionality
- Category: Logical flaw
- Source: TokenTransmuter.sol
- Status: Acknowledged
- Description: linearMultiplier and instantMultiplier are used to calculate output token amount from input token amount in transmute functions.

```solidity
uint256 allocation = (_inputTokenAmount * linearMultiplier) /
tokenDecimalDivider;
uint256 allocation = (_inputTokenAmount * instantMultiplier) / tokenDecimalDivider;
```

The issue is that they are uint256 variables and can only multiply _inputTokenAmount, not divide it. It results in limited functionality of the protocol as vesting pairs where output tokens are valued more than input tokens cannot be used.
- Recommended mitigation: Add a boolean state variable which will describe whether to multiply or divide by the multiplier.
- Team response: Acknowledged, but will not be fixed at this time as use case does not require division.

### TRST-L-4 tokenDecimalDivider implementation causes limited functionality
- Category: Logical flaw
- Source: TokenTransmuter.sol
- Status: Acknowledged
- Description: tokenDecimalDivider stores the decimals difference between input token and output token. However, this value assumes input decimals is always larger or equal to output decimals. As a result, the contract cannot be used for many input/output token pairs.

```solidity
uint256 allocation = (_inputTokenAmount * linearMultiplier) /tokenDecimalDivider;
```

### Recommended mitigation
tokenDecimalDivider stores the decimals difference between input token and output token.However, this value assumes input decimals is always larger or equal to output decimals. As
a result, the contract cannot be used for many input/output token pairs.

```solidity
uint256 allocation = (_inputTokenAmount * linearMultiplier) /
tokenDecimalDivider;
```

- Recommended mitigation: Add a boolean state variable which will describe whether to divide or multiply by tokenDecimalDivider.

- Team response: Acknowledged, but will not be fixed at this time as use case does not require division.

### TRST-L-5 transmute functions may charge input tokens but not allocate any output tokens
- Category: precision loss
- Source: TokenTransmuter.sol
- Status: Fixed
- Description `transmuteInstant()` calculates and distributes allocation like so:

```solidity
uint256 allocation = (_inputTokenAmount * instantMultiplier) /tokenDecimalDivider;
IERC20(inputTokenAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(0),_inputTokenAmount);
SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(outputTokenAddress), msg.sender,allocation);
```

The issue is that allocation result could be zero due to division by tokenDecimalDivider which trims many decimal points. If user does not provide a sufficient input amount,allocation will be zero but the function won't revert. Therefore, function will charge user the input amount but not give in return any output amount. The issue repeats in `transmuteLinear()`. It is not severe because if allocation is zero, input amount was probably quite small, but still important to address for user experience.

- Recommended mitigation: If allocation amount is calculated to be zero, revert in transmute functions.
- Team response: Issue was fixed
- Mitigation review: Successful fix.

## Additional recommendations
### Immutable-only variables:
The contract currently makes use of two immutable variables. However, there are several more variables which do not change throughout the lifetime of the contract. It is very advisable to make them immutable as it saves gas and protects against future errors.

### Safety checks:
The constructor and setter functions lack some important safety checks. For example, it is important to make sure vestingEntryStartTime < vestingEntryEndTime, at all times. Also, the DAO multisig address should be verified to not be zero.

### Mitigation review:
Additional safety checks properly implemented.

### NatSpec documentation:
It is recommended to document code using NatSpec syntax which also supports autogenerated documentation resources.

### Centralization risks:
#### The `emergencyPull introduces substantial risks
The `emergencyPull()` function is only callable by owner, and transfers the entire output token balance to a controlled destination. Use of `emergencyPull()` will make any linear
vesting be cancelled without refund to the user. It is recommended that only the non-allocated output tokens can be transferred out, as done in outputTokenPull(). Additionally,project should make sure the multisig address has a timelock in order to further protect users from compromised owner scenarios.

- Mitigation review
The fix adds a check that remaining balance is greater than the required balance, but actually transfers the entire output token balance. It should transfer out only the delta. Therefore, the previous issue still exists.

```solidity
uint256 outputTokenBalance =IERC20(outputTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 vestingRequiredBalance = totalAllocatedOutputToken -totalReleasedOutputToken;
require(outputTokenBalance > vestingRequiredBalance,"NO_UNALLOCATED_TOKENS");
SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(outputTokenAddress),_emergencyOutputDestination,IERC20(outputTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this)));
```

#### Owner can pause withdrawals of vested amount
Owner can use setEmergencyPause() to set the isPaused flag. The flag is checked in both transmute functions and releaseTransmuteLinear(). As a result, owner can immediately suspend withdrawals of vested amount. It is advisable that the pause flag would only be applied to transmute functions as it is severe for users to not be able to withdraw an already vested amount.

- Mitigation review
Centralization issue fixed.
