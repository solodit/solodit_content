## High Risk
### TRST-H-1 User fee  token  balance  can  be  drained in  a  single  operation  by a  malicious bot
**Description:**
In _buildFeeExecutable(),  BrahRouter  calculates  the  total  fee  charged  to  the  wallet.  It  uses tx.gaspriceto get the gas price specified by the bot.
 
 ```solidity 

 if (feeToken == ETH) 
 {uint256 totalFee = (gasUsed + GAS_OVERHEAD_NATIVE) * tx.gasprice;
 totalFee = _applyMultiplier(totalFee);
 return (totalFee, recipient, TokenTransfer._nativeTransferExec(recipient, totalFee));
 } else {uint256 totalFee = (gasUsed + GAS_OVERHEAD_ERC20) * tx.gasprice;
// Convert fee amount value in fee tokenuint256 feeToCollect =PriceFeedManager(_addressProvider.priceFeedManager()).getTokenXPriceInY(totalFee, ETH, feeToken);
feeToCollect = _applyMultiplier(feeToCollect);
return (feeToCollect, recipient, TokenTransfer._erc20TransferExec(feeToken, recipient, feeToCollect));}
```

**Impact:**
The issue is that a malicious bot can manipulate tx.gaspriceto be as high as they wish. This value is calculated post EIP1559 as the block base fee plus the sender's priority fee. A bot can offer an extremely high priority fee to drain the user's fee token balance. These losses will go to the Brahma fund manager. 

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Use a gas oracle or a capped priority fee to ensureaninflated gas price down not harm the user.


**Team response:**
There  exist  some  scenarios  where  high  gas  may  be  required  for  quick  block  inclusion  like liquidation protection. An additional check is not worth the added oracle gas cost for this.We  use  reputable  3rd  party  bots  like  gelato  which  work  in  a decentralizedfashion  for  bot operators.  operators  stake  GEL  tokens  which  get  slashed  if  they  submit  txns  with  high  gas price.  Even  if  they  do  so,  they  have  less  economic  incentive  to  do  so  as  the  gas  fee  will  be burned rather than being paid to the miner. If a 3rd party bot still tries to abuse it, they can be kicked by the governance usingBotManager.sol.



### TRST-H-2Users can drain Gelato deposit at little cost
**Description:**
In Console automation, fees are collected via the claimExecutionFees()modifier:

```solidity 
modifier claimExecutionFees(address _wallet) {
    uint256 startGas = gasleft();
_;
if (feeMultiplier > 0) {
    address feeToken = FeePayer._feeToken(_wallet);
uint256 gasUsed = startGas -gasleft();
(uint256 feeAmount, address recipient, Types.Executable memory feeTransferTxn)=FeePayer._buildFeeExecutable
(gasUsed, feeToken);
emit FeeClaimed(_wallet, feeToken, feeAmount);
if (feeToken != ETH) {uint256 initialBalance = IERC20(feeToken).balanceOf(recipient);_
executeSafeERC20Transfer(_wallet, feeTransferTxn);
if (IERC20(feeToken).balanceOf(recipient) -initialBalance < feeAmount){
    revert UnsuccessfulFeeTransfer(_wallet, feeToken);}
    } else {
    uint256 initialBalance = recipient.balance;
 Executor._executeOnWallet(_wallet, feeTransferTxn);
if (recipient.balance -initialBalance < feeAmount) {
    revert UnsuccessfulFeeTransfer(_wallet, feeToken);
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
   
   **Impact:**
 The actual strategy processing happens in _; , then the total fee is calculated using the gas used up to this point.
 The issue is that a malicious user can get arbitrary execution in the actual payment stage. It is easy to create and register a custom wallet contract as a Safe contract. In _executeOnWallet(), the contract would be called to deliver the payment request. However, the malicious contract can execute anything at this point. It could use up a large amount of gas and convert it to gas tokens likeCHI. It would only pay for the strategy execution, which could be negligible compared to actual gas usage. The Gelato deposit in GelatoBot could be drained with little cost.


**Recommended Mitigation:**
When calculating fees in buildFeeExecutable(), there are assumptions about the gas cost of an ERC20 transfer and a native transfer.

```solidity
// Keeper network overhead -150k
uint256 internal constant GAS_OVERHEAD_NATIVE = 150_000 + 40_000;
uint256 internal constant GAS_OVERHEAD_ERC20 = 150_000 + 90_000;
```
A good fix would be to check the actual gas usage and require it to be under the hard cap.Team responseAdded a gas check for this attack.Mitigation reviewApplied fix has been applied.

**Team Response:**
Added a gas check for this attack

**Mitigation review:**
Applied fix has been applied



### TRST-H-3 Attackers can drain users over time by donating negligible ERC20 amount
**Description:**
In the Console automation model, a strategy shall keep executing until its trigger check fails. For DCA strategies, the swapping trigger is defined as:

```solidity

function canInitSwap(address subAccount, address inputToken, uint256 interval, uint256 lastSwap)
external view returns (bool)
 {
    if (hasZeroBalance(subAccount, inputToken)) 
      { return false;
}
return ((lastSwap + interval) < block.timestamp);
}
```
**Impact:**
Note that every execution will charge the user for gas costs, which can be expensive. The issue is that whenever the account is empty, anyone can donate inputToken to the user, which will make the check pass periodically. It would keep executing a negligible swap order. The bot will not unsubscribe the user from the strategy because the exit trigger is defined to be zero balance for the user, which attacker can ensure will never be true.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Define a DUST_AMOUNT, below that amount exit is allowed, while above that amount swap execution is allowed. User should only stand to gain from another party donating ERC20 tokens to their account.

**Team response:**
Fix DCA automation to only swap requested amount.
Mitigation review


**Mitigation review:**
Fixed.

### TRST-H-4 Executors can drain the Gelato deposit while profiting from free gas
**Description:**
As discussed, claimExecutionFees() charges the user for gas fees. Since wallet is not trusted, the payment is wrapped and checked that the balance increased by the required amount.

```solidity
 if (feeToken != ETH) {
  uint256 initialBalance = IERC20(feeToken).balanceOf(recipient);
   _executeSafeERC20Transfer(_wallet, feeTransferTxn);
     if (IERC20(feeToken).balanceOf(recipient) - initialBalance < feeAmount)
 {
revert UnsuccessfulFeeTransfer(_wallet, feeToken);
}
} else {
uint256 initialBalance = recipient.balance; Executor._executeOnWallet(_wallet, feeTransferTxn); if (recipient.balance - initialBalance < feeAmount) {
revert UnsuccessfulFeeTransfer(_wallet, feeToken);
         }
   }
```
**Impact:**

While the check is sound, it can be bypassed because the execution functions are not protected from reentrancy. A bot attacker can profit by registering a malicious wallet contract, which reenters for the execution of another strategy on their wallet. At this point, the initialBalance will be the same as the previous initialBalance. The contract may reenter many times, and at the final iteration it will actually pay the feeAmount. When the TXs unwind, it will appear as the fee has been paid for all transactions, although it has only been paid for the last one. This can be abused to claim the gas costs from the GelatoBot deposit, while converting the free gas to gas tokens to net profit.

**Recommended mitigation:**
Mark the execution functions as nonReentrant.
Both execution functions are protected by a reentrancy guard.






 ## Medium Risk
### TRST-M-1 When FeePayer is subsidizing, users can steal gas
**Description:**
The feeMultiplier enables the admin to subsidize or upcharge for the automation service.
/**
⦁	@notice feeMultiplier represents the total fee to be charged on the transaction
⦁	Is set to 100% by default
⦁	@dev In case feeMultiplier is less than BASE_BPS, fees charged will be less than 100%,
⦁	subsidizing the transaction
⦁	In case feeMultiplier is greater than BASE_BPS, fees charged will be greater than 100%,
⦁	charging the user for the transaction
*/
```solidity 
uint16 public feeMultiplier = 10_000;
// The normal fee is calculated and then processed by the multiplier.
if (feeToken == ETH) {
 uint256 totalFee = (gasUsed + GAS_OVERHEAD_NATIVE) * tx.gasprice; 
   totalFee = _applyMultiplier(totalFee);
return (totalFee, recipient, TokenTransfer._nativeTransferExec(recipient, totalFee));
} else {

```

**Impact:**
The issue is that Brahma stands to lose up to Gelato deposit x subsidization %. Gas can be stolen by setting up a malicious wallet and programming the adapter function (likely execTransactionFromModuleReturnData()), to mint a popular gas token such as CHI or GST2. Then, attacker can schedule an ever-occurring automation which will trigger their gas minting logic.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
The root cause is that the gasUsed amount is subsidized as well as GAS_OVERHEAD_NATIVE, which is the gas reserved for the delivery from Gelato executors. By subsidizing only the Gelato gas portion, users will not gain from gas minting attacks, while the intention of improving user experience is maintained.


**Team Response:**
Thanks, duly noted. The subsidy is meant to be used during small-time promotional events. Acknowledged.



### TRST-M-2 Strategy actions could be executed out of order due to lack of reentrancy guard

**Description:**
The Execute module performs automation of the fetched Executable array on wallet subaccounts.

```solidity
function
 _executeAutomation( address _wallet,
  address _subAccount,
   address _strategy,
Types.Executable[] memory _actionExecs
) internal {
uint256 actionLen = _actionExecs.length;
 if (actionLen == 0) {
revert InvalidActions();
} else {
uint256 idx = 0;
 do {
_executeOnSubAccount(_wallet, _subAccount, _strategy,
_actionExecs[idx]);
unchecked {
++idx;
        }
      } while (idx < actionLen);
    }
  }
```

**Impact:**
Note that there are no uses of reentrancy guards in this function or any above it in the call chain. As a result, a bot or a keeper can execute operations out of sequence. For example, instead of actions called as [1,2,3], it could call [1,[1,2,3],2,3]. As a result, security guarantees are bypassed which can have unforeseen impacts on future strategies. Using the DCA strategy as an example, consider that it is composed of two actions. The first performs the swap while the second updates the block.timestamp of the last swap, so that a future automation will need to wait the appropriate interval. Through abusing the reentrancy, a bot could execute the strategy an unlimited number of times. As a result, it becomes a single spot swap instead of a DCA swap. A requirement for this attack is that at some point during execution, the strategy will interact with an external address that belongs to the keeper or bot.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Add a reentrancy guard for executeAutomationViaBot() and executeTrustedAutomation().


**Team Response:**
Fixed as suggested.



### TRST-M-3 Anyone can make creating strategies extremely expensive for the user
**Description:**
In Console architecture, users can deploy spare subaccounts (Gnosis Safes) so that when they will subscribe to a strategy most of the gas spending would have been spent at a low-gas phase.
```solidity
function deploySpareSubAccount(address _wallet) external { address subAccount =
SafeDeployer(addressProvider.safeDeployer()).deploySubAccount(_wallet);
subAccountToWalletMap[subAccount] = _wallet; walletToSubAccountMap[_wallet].push(subAccount);
// No need to update subAccountStatus as it is already set to false
emit SubAccountAllocated(_wallet, subAccount);
}
```

**Impact**
The issue is that anyone can call the deploy function and specify another user's wallet. While on the surface that sounds like donating gas costs, in practice this functionality can make operating with strategies prohibitively expensive.
When users will subscribe to strategies, the StrategyRegistry will request a subaccount using this function:
```solidity
function requestSubAccount(address _wallet) external returns (address) {
if (msg.sender != subscriptionRegistry) 
revert OnlySubscriptionRegistryCallable();
// Try to find a subAccount which already exists
address[] memory subAccountList = walletToSubAccountMap[_wallet];
```

At this point, the entire subaccount array will be copied from storage to memory. Therefore, attackers can fill the array with hundreds of elements at a low-gas time and make creation of strategies very difficult.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Limit the amount of spare subaccount to something reasonable, like 10
**Team Response:**
Removing the spare subaccount deployment
**Mitigation review:**
Attack surface has been removed.



### TRST-M-4 DCA strategies may not be effective at averaging spot prices
**Description:**
The DCA strategies periodically set off CoW Swap orders, according to the specified interval. The order TTL is fixed at 2 hours. When interval is not an order of magnitude larger than TTL, the strategy does not average effectively. An order fulfilled near the end of the TTL window would be priced much closer to the next order. When interval < TTL, consecutive orders can be executed at the same time.

**Recommendation:**
TTL should be a dynamic value based on the user's specified interval. Team response
User makes this DCA subscription call with interval that they decide. We don't support intervals less than a day. If they chose to try interval less than a day, which means less than effective averaging, that's their prerogative.


### TRST-M-5 DCA Strategies build orders that may not be executable, wasting fees
**Description:** 
In _buildInitiateSwapExecutable(), DCA strategies determine the swap parameters for the CoW Swap. The code has recently been refactored so that there may be more than one active order simultaneously. The issue is that the function assumes the user's entire ERC20 balance to be available for the order being built.
```solidity
// Check if enough balance present to swap, else swap entire balance
 uint256 amountIn = (inputTokenBalance < params.amountToSwap) ? 
 inputTokenBalance : params.amountToSwap;
```
 **Impact**
 This is a problem because if the previous order will be executed before the current order, there may not be enough funds to pull from the user to execute the swap. As a result, transaction execution fees are wasted.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Ensure only one swap can be in-flight at a time, or deduct the in-flight swap amounts from the current balance.

**Team response:**
Set min interval during initialization to more than 2 hours.

**Mitigation review:**
Fix works as interval > TTL at any point.


### TRST-M-6 User will lose all Console functionality when upgrading their wallet and an upgrade target has not been set up
**Description:** 
Console supports upgrading of the manager wallet using the upgradeWalletType() function.

```solidity
function upgradeWalletType() external {
  if (!isWallet(msg.sender)) 
   revert WalletDoesntExist(msg.sender); uint8 fromWalletType = _walletDataMap[msg.sender].walletType;
    _setWalletType(msg.sender, _upgradablePaths[fromWalletType]);
     emit WalletUpgraded(msg.sender, fromWalletType,
_upgradablePaths[fromWalletType]);
}
```

Note that upgradablePaths are set by governance. There is a lack of check that the upgradable path is defined before performing the upgrade.

```solidity
function _setWalletType(address _wallet, uint8 _walletType) private {
_walletDataMap[_wallet].walletType = _walletType;
}```


If _upgradablePaths[fromWalletType] is zero (uninitialized), the user's wallet type shall become zero too. However, zero is an invalid value, as defined by the isWallet() view function:
```solidity
function isWallet(address _wallet) public view returns (bool) 
{ WalletData memory walletData = _walletDataMap[_wallet];
if (walletData.walletType == 0 || walletData.feeToken == address(0)){
         return false;
      }
   return true;
 }
```

 **Impact**
 As a result, most of the functionality of Console is permanently broken when users upgrade their wallet when an upgrade path isn't set. They can salvage their funds if it is a Safe account, as they can still execute on it directly.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
When settings a new wallet type, make sure the new type is not zero.

**Team response:**
Remove upgradable feature, replaced with deregistering wallet.

**Mitigation review:**
Relevant code has been removed.



## Low Risk
### TRST-L-1 CoW Swap orders are seen as filled although they are cancelled

**Description:**
CoW Swap orders prepared by DCAStrategy can be cancelled using the following function.
```solidity
function cancelCowOrder(bytes calldata orderUid) internal
 { settlement.setPreSignature(orderUid, false); 
   settlement.invalidateOrder(orderUid);
}
```

Order status is viewed by isOrderFullyFilled():
```solidity
function isOrderFullyFilled(bytes calldata orderUid) internal view returns (bool) {
return settlement.filledAmount(orderUid) > 0;
}
```


An issue arises from the fact invalidateOrder on GPv2Settlement sets the filledAmount to MAX_UINT256.
```solidity
function invalidateOrder(bytes calldata orderUid) external {
     (, address owner, ) = orderUid.extractOrderUidParams();
require(owner == msg.sender, "GPv2: caller does not own order");
 filledAmount[orderUid] = uint256(-1);
emit OrderInvalidated(owner, orderUid);
} 
```

**Impact:**
As a result, the order is wrongly viewed as filled.
**Recommended Mitigation:**
Remove the invalidateOrder() call as setPreSignature(order_uid,false) is adequate to cancel the order

**Team Response:**
Adding valid cancellation order.

**Mitigation review:**
Fix has been applied.



### TRST-L-2 Rounding error causes an additional iteration of DCA strategies
**Description:**
Both CoW strategies receive an interval and total amountIn of tokens to swap. They calculate the amount per iteration as below:
```solidity
Types.TokenRequest[] memory tokens = new Types.TokenRequest[](1); 
tokens[0] = Types.TokenRequest({token: inputToken, amount: amountIn});
amountIn = amountIn / iterations;
StrategyParams memory params = StrategyParams({ tokenIn: inputToken,
tokenOut: outputToken, amountToSwap: amountIn, interval: interval, remitToOwner: remitToOwner
});
```

**Impact:**
There is a precision loss error in the amountIn calculation. It will result in an additional iteration to be executed with the division remainder, as amountIn > amountIn / iterations * iterations. There will be gas wasted for another automation call.


**Recommended Mitigation:**
Change the amount requested from the management wallet to amountIn / iterations * iterations.

**Team Response:**
Used amountIn as minimum order amount.
**Mitigation review:**
Refactor in order processing makes the issue no longer possible. Money will be returned from subaccount on the last iteration.


### TRST-L-3 Fee mismatch between contracts can make strategies unusable
**Description:**

In CoW Swap strategies, fee is set in the strategy contracts and then passed to initiateSwap(). It is built in _buildInitiateSwapExecutable():
```solidity
// Generate executable to initiate swap on DCACoWAutomation return Types.Executable({
callType: Types.CallType.DELEGATECALL, target: dcaCoWAutomation,
value: 0,
data: abi.encodeCall( DCACoWAutomation.initiateSwap,
(params.tokenIn, params.tokenOut, swapRecipient, amountIn, minAmountOut, swapFee)
)
});
```

There is a mismatch between the constraints around fees between the strategy contracts and the initiateSwap() function:

```solidity
function setSwapFee(uint256 _swapFee) external {
_onlyGov();
if (_swapFee > 10_000) { revert InvalidSlippage();
}
swapFee = _swapFee;
}


if (feeBps > 0) {
if (feeBps > 1_000) revert FeeTooHigh();
amountIn = amountToSwap * (MAX_BPS - feeBps) / MAX_BPS;
```

**Impact:**
If admins set the swapFee to be between 1000 and 10000, it will brick all uses of the strategies.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Enforce the same constraints on the fee percentage in both contracts, or remove the check from one of them as part of a simplified security model.


**Team response:**
Set feeBPS to 1000 max in both.

**Mitgation review:**
Fixed applied.


## Informational Findings
  ### Explicit matching of enum values

In _packMultisendTxns(), the TX call type is checked.
```solidity
// Enum.Operation.Call is 0
uint8 call = uint8(Enum.Operation.Call);
if (_txns[i].callType == Types.CallType.DELEGATECALL) { call 
= uint8(Enum.Operation.DelegateCall);
} else if (_txns[i].callType == Types.CallType.STATICCALL)
 { revert InvalidMultiSendCall();
}
```

When callType is not DELEGATECALL or STATICCALL, it assumes it is a normal call. From a design perspective, it is better to always explicitly match types, as future changes, such as adding new enum values, may silently break such assumptions and cause significant issues.

### Redundant casting

In initRegistry(), the registry contracts are converted to addresses although they are already defined as such.
```solidity
if (key == RegistryKey.STRATEGY) {
_firstInit(address(strategyRegistry)); strategyRegistry = (_newAddress);
} else if (key == RegistryKey.SUBSCRIPTION) {
_firstInit(address(subscriptionRegistry)); subscriptionRegistry = (_newAddress);


Emit events on important state changes
```
When the BrahRouter is paused using setEmergencyPause(), no event is emitted. Similarly, there is no event when the feeMultiplier changes. It is very recommended to emit events on important lifecycle changes for transparency.

### GelatoBot creates tasks with unused _execDataOrSelector

When initiating tasks, GelatoBot uses the following code:
```solidty
bytes32 currentTask = automate.createTask( address(this), // _execAddress
abi.encodeCall(this.execute, (strategy, wallet, subAccount, automationId)), // _execDataOrSelector
moduleData, // _moduleData address(0) // _feeToken
);
```

However, since it uses the RESOLVER module, the _execDataOrSelector parameter is unused, as the actual parameter passed to the execAddress is what is returned from the resolver. It is recommended to pass an empty bytes type to save gas and improve clarity.

### Missing zero-address checks in Registry contracts

The AddressProviderService inherited by the registry contracts copies the registry values internally in the constructor.
```solidity
constructor(address _addressProvider) {
if (_addressProvider == address(0)) revert InvalidAddressProvider();
addressProvider = AddressProvider(_addressProvider); strategyRegistry = addressProvider.strategyRegistry(); subscriptionRegistry = addressProvider.subscriptionRegistry(); subAccountRegistry = addressProvider.subAccountRegistry(); walletAdapterRegistry = addressProvider.walletAdapterRegistry(); walletRegistry = addressProvider.walletRegistry();
}
```


If one of the registries is not initialized, the constructor will exit gracefully. It is worth adding this validation which will only occur per construction and not cost much gas.


## Centralization risks

## CoW-Swap risks

The DCA strategy approves user funds to the vaultRelayer contract in the CoW infrastructure. If 3rd-party contracts are compromised or contain a vulnerability in the order processing, users could loss up to the entire order amount.


## Governance-related risks

There are several ways in which a malicious or hacked governance can take user funds. Through the WalletAdapterRegistry, governance can register new wallet adapters arbitrarily. A malicious adapter can be abused easily as it can transform an incoming benign transaction to a draining TX.
```solidity
function _executeOnWallet(address _wallet, Types.Executable memory_txn) 
internal returns (bytes memory) {
if (isEmergencyPaused) revert EmergencyPaused();
// Get wallet adapter for the wallet
IWalletAdapter adapter = findWalletAdapter(_wallet);
// Format transaction into a BrahRouter compatible executable
Types.Executable memory formattedTxn = adapter.formatForWallet(_wallet, _txn);
// Execute transaction
(bool success, bytes memory result) = _execute(formattedTxn);
// Check if transaction was successful and return data require(success, string(abi.encodePacked("brahRouter call fail",
result)));
(bool txnSuccess, bytes memory txnResult) = adapter.decodeReturnData(result);
require(txnSuccess, string(abi.encodePacked("wallet call fail", txnResult)));
return (txnResult);
}
```

Governance can also call setFeeMultiplier() to instantly bump the fee up to 140%. This way, a user would end up paying far more than they expected for the TX.
Governance can set up a malicious price feed, which could drain user funds through the fee mechanism.


## Console-admin risks

Through the trusted execution infrastructure, the delegated Console keeper calls this function for automation:
```solidity
function executeTrustedAutomation( address _wallet, 
address _subAccount, address _strategy,
Types.Executable[] memory _actionExecs)
 external claimExecutionFees(_wallet) { Authorizer._validateConsoleKeeper(); Authorizer._validateTrustedSubscription(_subAccount, _strategy);
  Executor._executeAutomation(_wallet, _subAccount, _strategy,_actionExecs);
emit TrustedExecution(_subAccount, _strategy);
}
```

As can be seen, it passes an Executable array, instead of requesting it from the strategy. Also, no trigger checks take place. The only check is done when invoking the action on subaccount:
```solidity
function _executeOnSubAccount(address _owner, address _subAccount,
 address strategy, Types.Executable memory _txn)
internal
returns (bytes memory)
{
if (!IStrategy(strategy).isExecutionAllowed(_txn.callType,
_txn.target, _subAccount)) revert StrategyBlocked();
```

Strategy needs to approve the (callType, target, subaccount) combo. In Trusted-DCA strategy, the check is not satisfactory to protect against malicious wallet drains. It's not possible for the function to decode the recipient data as it does not receive the calldata.


## Gelato risks

The GelatoBot contract deposits ETH for gas fees into the Gelato system. If Gelato, due to malicious reasons or due to a bug, charges more gas than required for the transaction, the balance would be deducted by this amount. It is worth noting that Gelato is planning to decentralize its Executor infrastructure, meaning anyone could potentially abuse the Gelato automation.
